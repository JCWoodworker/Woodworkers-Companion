**Easiest way:**
```bash
cd woodworkers-companion-mobile
./setup.sh
```

**Or manually:**
```bash
cd woodworkers-companion-mobile
npm install
npx expo install expo-router expo-linear-gradient expo-file-system expo-sharing react-native-safe-area-context react-native-reanimated @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
npm install nativewind
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss
```

### Step 3: Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

Then press:
- `i` for iOS Simulator
- `a` for Android Emulator
- Or scan QR code with Expo Go app

### Step 4: Test Everything

Focus on the Board Foot Calculator:
- Add boards
- Edit boards
