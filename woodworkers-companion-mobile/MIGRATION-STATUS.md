## ⚠️ Before Running

### Node.js Version Requirement
**CRITICAL**: Upgrade to Node.js 20+ before running the app.

Current system: Node v16.20.0
Required: Node v20.19.4+

#### Upgrade Instructions
```bash
# Using nvm (recommended)
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20

# Verify
node --version  # Should show v20.x.x
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
cd woodworkers-companion-mobile

# Clean install (after Node upgrade)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## 🚀 Running the App

Once Node.js is upgraded and dependencies are installed:

```bash
# Start development server
npm start

# Then choose:
# - Press 'i' for iOS simulator
# - Press 'a' for Android emulator  
# - Scan QR with Expo Go app on physical device
```
