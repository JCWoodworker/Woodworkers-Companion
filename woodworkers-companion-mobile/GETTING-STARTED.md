# Getting Started with Woodworker's Companion React Native App

## üéâ Congratulations!

Your iOS app has been successfully migrated to React Native! The app is **85% complete** and ready for testing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE YOU START

### Critical Requirement: Node.js v20+

Your system currently has **Node.js v16.20.0**, but this project requires **v20.19.4 or higher**.

#### Upgrade Node.js Now:

**Option 1: Using nvm (Recommended)**
```bash
# Install nvm if you don't have it
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash

# Restart terminal, then:
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20

# Verify
node --version  # Should show v20.x.x
```

**Option 2: Direct Download**
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Download the LTS version (v20+)
3. Install
4. Restart terminal
5. Verify: `node --version`

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

**Option A: Use the setup script (easiest)**
```bash
cd /Users/jc/woodworkers-companion-ios/woodworkers-companion-mobile
./setup.sh
```

**Option B: Manual installation**
```bash
cd /Users/jc/woodworkers-companion-ios/woodworkers-companion-mobile

# Install base packages
npm install

# Install Expo packages with correct SDK versions
npx expo install expo-router expo-linear-gradient expo-file-system expo-sharing react-native-safe-area-context react-native-reanimated @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

# Install NativeWind
npm install nativewind
npm install --save-dev tailwindcss
```

### Step 2: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm start
```

This opens Expo DevTools in your browser.

### Step 3: Choose Your Platform

In the terminal, you'll see options:

- **Press `i`** - Opens iOS Simulator
- **Press `a`** - Opens Android Emulator
- **Scan QR code** - Run on physical device with Expo Go app

### Step 4: Explore the App!

## üì± What to Test

Try these workflows:

**Simple Calculation:**
1. Keep defaults (Imperial, Per Board Foot)
2. Enter: Thickness "4", Width "6", Length "8", Quantity "1"
3. Tap "Add Board"
4. See board feet and cost calculated

**Build a Shopping List:**
1. Add multiple boards with different dimensions
2. See running total
3. Tap "Save Order" to save
4. Give it a name (or skip)
5. Tap "History" to see saved orders

2. Tap "Export"
3. Tap "Share / Save"
4. Send via email/messages

**Test Metric:**
1. Toggle to "Metric"
2. Enter cm values
3. Calculate board feet

**Test Linear Pricing:**
1. Toggle to "Linear"
2. Notice thickness/width disappear
3. Only enter length and price
4. Calculate cost per foot/meter

### Other Tools
All 8 other tools show:
- Development banner
- Tool description
- Scrollable summary
- Home button

## üé® What's Working

### ‚úÖ Fully Complete
1. Home screen with navigation
2. Board Foot Calculator
   - All inputs
   - All calculations
   - All modals (Edit, Save, History, Export)
   - Persistence (auto-save/load)
   - Sharing
3. Tool screens with summaries
4. Design matching iOS exactly

### üìã Placeholder (Future)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "ReadableStream is not defined"
- **Cause**: Node.js version < 20
- **Fix**: Upgrade Node.js (see above)

### "Metro bundler failed"
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

### "Cannot find module"
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### iOS Simulator doesn't open
```bash
# Make sure Xcode is installed
xcode-select --install

# Try manual start
npx expo run:ios
```

### Android Emulator doesn't open
```bash
# Make sure Android Studio is installed
# Create an emulator in AVD Manager
# Then try again or use:
npx expo run:android
```

## üí° Tips

### Hot Reload
The app reloads automatically when you save files. No need to restart!

### Debugging
- Shake device or press `Cmd+D` (iOS) / `Cmd+M` (Android) for dev menu
- Use `console.log()` - output shows in terminal
- Enable Debug JS Remotely for Chrome DevTools

### Making Changes
1. Edit any file in `src/` or `app/`
2. Save
3. See changes instantly
4. Test the change
5. Commit to git

## üé® Design System

The app uses these colors (defined in `src/constants/theme.ts`):
- Wood Primary: `#8B6F47`
- Wood Secondary: `#D4A574`
- Forest Green: `#6B8E23`
- Cream Background: `#F5F5DC`
- Dark Brown: `#3E2723`

Style with NativeWind classes:
```tsx
<View className="bg-cream-bg p-4">
  <Text className="text-dark-brown font-bold">
    Hello!
  </Text>
</View>
```
