# 🎉 SUCCESS! Your App is Running!

## ✅ All Issues Resolved

The app is now starting in the background!

### What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Node.js upgraded to v20.19.4
2. ✅ React updated to 19.2.0 (fixing peer dependency)
3. ✅ React-dom added (required by expo-router)
4. ✅ All dependencies installed successfully
5. ✅ Expo dev server is starting

## 👀 What to Look For

The Expo DevTools should open in your browser shortly, showing:
- QR code
- Development server URL
- Options to open iOS/Android

Or check your terminal for:
```
› Metro waiting on exp://192.168.1.xxx:8081
› Scan the QR code above with Expo Go (Android) or the Camera app (iOS)

› Press i │ open iOS simulator
› Press a │ open Android emulator
```

## 📱 To Open in iOS Simulator

In the terminal where Expo is running, press:
```
i
```

Or if the QR code is showing, you can also:
- Scan it with your iPhone camera app
- It will open in Expo Go app

## 🎯 What You'll See

## 🐛 If You Don't See the App

### Check Terminal

### Manual Start
If needed, you can press 'i' in the terminal to open iOS Simulator.

### If iOS Simulator Doesn't Open
```bash
# Make sure Xcode is installed
xcode-select --install

# Or open simulator manually:
