## 🔢 Calculation Accuracy

All formulas have been ported exactly from Swift:

### Board Foot (Imperial)
```
Thickness (quarters) / 4 = Thickness (inches)
Length (in or ft) → Length (ft)
Board Feet = (T" × W" × L') / 12 × Qty
```

### Board Foot (Metric)
```
Board Feet = (T × W × L) / 2359.737 × Qty
(where 1 board foot = 2359.737 cm³)
```

### Linear Pricing
```
Cost = Length × Price × Qty
```

### Cost Calculation
```
Per Board Foot: BF × Price
Linear: Length × Price × Qty
```

## 💾 Data Management

### AsyncStorage Keys
- `@BoardFootCalculator:workInProgress` - Current session
- `@BoardFootCalculator:savedOrders` - Order history
- `@BoardFootCalculator:orderCounter` - Auto-increment counter

### Auto-Save Behavior
- Saves after every board add/edit/delete
- Loads automatically on app open
- Clears after saving an order
- Prevents data loss on app close
