## 🚀 How to Run

### Current Issue
The app tried to start but hit the NativeWind dependency issue. This is now **FIXED**!

### To Run Now:

The Expo server is starting in the background. You should see it open soon!

If you need to restart:
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C if in terminal)
cd woodworkers-companion-mobile
npm start
# Press 'i' for iOS
```

### For Best Experience
Upgrade to Node 20+ (eliminates all warnings):
```bash
nvm install 20
nvm use 20
nvm alias default 20
```

Then reinstall and run:
```bash
cd woodworkers-companion-mobile
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
npm start
```
